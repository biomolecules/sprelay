/*!
 * \def SPRELAY_MAIN_LIBRARY
 * \brief Define this macro if you want to change the behavior of `#SPRELAY_EXPORT` macro to compile `sprelay` as a
 * shared library.
 *
 * If you want the standalone application instead, you have to define `#SPRELAY_STANDALONE` macro. In client code, when
 * you only use the shared library, you must not define either of these two macros.
 *
 * You can define the `#SPRELAY_MAIN_LIBRARY` macro for example by passing `-DSPRELAY_MAIN_LIBRARY` flag to compiler.
 *
 * Every declaration of symbol, which should be exported from the main shared library (i.e. code which is compiled as a
 * shared library or into standalone application according to the compilation settings) should contain the
 * `#SPRELAY_EXPORT` macro. The `#SPRELAY_LIBRARY_EXPORT` macro should be used instead for code which should always be
 * compiled as a shared library (despite the fact that the main part of the application is compiled as shared library
 * or a standalone application).
 *
 * Typically, clients will include only the public header files of shared libraries. These libraries might be installed
 * in a different location, when deployed. Therefore, it is important to exclude other internal header files that were
 * used when building the shared library. This can be avoided by making use of the Pointer to implementation idiom
 * described in various C++ programming books.
 *
 * \warning This macro shouldn't be defined in client code.
